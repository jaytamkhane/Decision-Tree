# Decision Tree Classifier Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using the Iris dataset. The model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using a confusion matrix.

## Features

- Loads the Iris dataset from sklearn

- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets

- Trains a Decision Tree Classifier

- Evaluates model performance using accuracy score

- Visualizes the confusion matrix using Seaborn

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:

   ` pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib jupyter `

## Usage

- To execute the Jupyter Notebook, run:

   ` jupyter notebook Decision_Tree_Assignment.ipynb `


## Output

- The script will print the accuracy of the classifier.

- A confusion matrix will be displayed as a heatmap.
